# BaseBenchmarks.jl

This package is a collection of Julia benchmarks available for CI tracking from the JuliaLang/julia repository.

The `master` branch holds benchmarks written for Julia v0.5, while the `release-0.4` branch holds benchmarks written for Julia v0.4. These branches should differ as little as possible - they only exist separately to avoid breakage between versions.
